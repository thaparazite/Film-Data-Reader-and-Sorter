# Film Data Reader and Sorter

## Project Overview:
The Film Data Reader and Sorter is a Java application designed to read film data from a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file, perform various operations on the data, and allow users to interactively sort the films based on different criteria. It provides functionalities such as reading film data from a file, calculating statistics on the data, sorting films by different columns, and adding new films to the list.

## Key Features:
|**Feature**|**Description**|
|----|-----------|
| Interactive Sorting  | Users can sort films by different columns, including film ID, title, genre, director name, length, and rating. |
| Data Analysis  | The program offers various data analysis options, such as calculating statistics on film lengths and finding specific information in the dataset. |
| Dynamic Film Addition  | Users can dynamically add new films to the list by providing details such as genre, director name, title, rating, and length. |
| Parallel Sorting  | Sorting operations are optimized using multithreading, enhancing performance for large datasets. |
| Exception Handling  | Robust exception handling is implemented to manage errors gracefully, ensuring data integrity. |
| File Management  | Users can save sorted data to separate files, enabling further analysis or sharing. |

## Getting Started:
### Note:
This note indicates that the compilation and execution steps assume that Java is already installed on your system. If not, please install Java before proceeding with the steps below. Let me know if you need further assistance!

#### Compilation and Execution Steps:
|**Step**|**Description**|
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Clone or download the repository to your local machine.|
| 2  | Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Java files.|
| 3  | Compile the Java files using the command: `javac FilmDataReaderAndSorter.java`.|
| 4  | Run the compiled program using the command: `java FilmDataReaderAndSorter`.|
| 5  | Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.|

## Sorting Films:
### Note:
Before sorting films, ensure that you have a CSV file containing film data. If you don't have one, you can create a new CSV file or use the provided sample file.

#### Sorting Steps:
|**Step**|**Description**|
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Upon running the program, you will be prompted to provide the path to the CSV file containing film data.|
| 2  | Once the data is loaded, you can choose from various options, including sorting films by different columns.|
| 3  | Select the desired sorting criterion, and the program will display the sorted films accordingly.|
| 4  | You can also add new films to the list by selecting the corresponding option and providing the necessary details.|

## Data Analysis:
### Note:
Data analysis features provide insights into the film dataset, including statistics and specific information retrieval.

#### Analysis Steps:
|**Step**|**Description**|
|----|-----------|
| 1  | To perform data analysis, select the option from the main menu.|
| 2  | Follow the prompts to choose the type of analysis you want to perform, such as calculating statistics or finding specific information in the dataset.|
| 3  | The program will execute the chosen analysis and display the results.|

## File Management:
### Note:
File management features allow you to save sorted data to a separate CSV file for further analysis or sharing.

#### File Management Steps:
|**Step**|**Description**|
|----|-----------|
| 1  | After sorting films, you have the option to save the sorted data to a separate file.|
| 2  | Choose the option to save data, and the program will prompt you for the filename.|
| 3  | Enter the desired filename, and the sorted data will be saved to a CSV file in the current directory.|
